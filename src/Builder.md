# Builder Pattern Analogy: Customized Laptop

### Summary of the Pattern
1. **Blueprint (`Car` Class)**:
   - Represents the product (`Car`) you want to build.
   - **Does not interact** directly with you to set properties.

2. **Builder (`ConcreteCarBuilder`)**:
   - The **builder** is like a **sales representative** who helps build your custom product.
   - You tell them:
     - “I want an **i7 processor**” (`setEngine()`).
     - “I need **16 GB RAM**” (`setWheels()`).
     - “Make it **black**” (`setColor()`).
   - The builder creates a draft instance (`this.car`) and **configures it step-by-step**.

3. **Final Product**:
   - After all choices are made, the builder **hands you the product** (`build()`).
   - Now you can use it—e.g., call `showDetails()` on your final `Car` object.

### Key Points
- **`Car` Class**: Like a **blueprint** of the laptop, defining all parts.
- **Builder**: Like a **sales rep**, building the product step-by-step.
- **Final Product**: After building, the product is ready, and **you can use it**.

This analogy helps you remember that the **builder** creates and configures the product, while the **Car class** is only a blueprint and doesn’t directly interact with you.
